# CA03 uses a census dataset to build a decision tree model best fit predicting income bracket. The first part goes through filtering out data quality
issues and visualizaing the most important variables. We then train and test the model utilizing different methods. Afterwards, we finetune the process
by changing hyperparamters and other metrics to guage the best model. 
After assessing the best variables and parameters, we analyze if there is any overfitting with the model.
